# StockTrader
Reinforcement Learning applied to the stock market

## Objective
Use modern state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms to make trades and manage trading portfolio over an extended period of time.

## Strategy

### Create a multi-purpose training environment for training reinforcement learning algorithms specifically for stock trading
Solution:
Create a training environment simulating day trading i.e. provide stock price in steps with rewards based on price change and current portfolio.
- OpenAI gym
Train a continuous environment reinforcement learning agent to maximize portfolio worth over the long term.
- DDPG algorithm
Train on stock data from a variety of markets and time periods. Fine-tune for a particular security and time period.
